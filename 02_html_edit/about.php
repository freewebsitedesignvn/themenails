          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <div class="groupabout">Bella Nail Lounge and Beauty Bar is located at 41 Maiden Lane in Newark NJ's<a href="http://www.teachers-village.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none; color:#e74f9c;">Teacher's Village.</a><br><br>                    Bella was created based on a day dream in late 2014 coupled with the frustrations of the limitations of accessible good service in an amazing environment with quality services, customer service and endless options in Newark (NJ).<br><br>                    I decided to stop looking for what I wanted and to create it. This led to a lot of research and planning to create an environment where women and men could get nail and beauty services in a beautiful community centered environment with friendly staff, reasonable prices, quality products and amazing customer service. When brainstorming on names for the nail lounge there was no brainstorming, it was always Bella. Bella in many languages means beauty and we want all of our customers to be, to feel, to exude beauty...... hence our favorite hashtags #beyou #bebeautiful #bebella as well as #notyouraverage.<br><br>                    What better place to do then the place we've called home since 2002, Newark NJ. What better place to be a part of change. What better way to show that we #believeinNewark<br><br>                    I teamed up with the amazing<a href="https://www.designedbybaileyli.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none; color:#e74f9c;">Bailey Li</a> Interiors to design an amazing space.  It was our goal to create a space that was simple yet glamourous, comfortable yet royal.<br><br>                    Say goodbye to uncomfortable pedicure benches and traditional whirlpool pedicure chairs with pipes and jets that are a breeding ground for harmful germs and bacteria. Claim your throne at Bella Nail Lounge and Beauty Bar where we offer a hygienic alternative to noisy pipes and jets.<br><br>                    It is our goal to provide customizable services by licensed associates with the highest level of competence and skill in the latest technology and products with unparalleled customer service and pampering.  We use a medical grade autoclave to sterilize our metal tools.  Sterilization is an added step after the tools are cleaned and sanitized. We also follow a no double dipping rule in all of our waxing services, wax sticks are not applied to one area of your body and then redipped in wax for another application. With the no double dipping policy the wax product is kept clean and safe for future use. We also use a number of single use or disposable items such as our pedicure abrasives and pedicure liners.<br><br>                    We have created<a href="Bella-Bath-Body" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none; color:#e74f9c;">Bella Bath and Body</a> soaks, scrubs, massage oils and lotions that are handmade that help detoxify, hydrate and soothe as well as gently exfoliate your skin.<br><br>                    Our mission is simple: Deliver amazing nail care and beauty services in a relaxed lounge like environment with a local community bar kind of feel with hospital grade sterilization and five star concierge customer service.<br><br>                    Sip our complementary beverages including coffee, wine, juice, tea or water as well as one of our signature specialty drinks such as the Bellatini, Peachtini, Cocoloso or a Lulutini while you enjoy the fabulous.<br>#meetusinnewark<br>#ittakesavillage<br>#iambella<br>#youarebella<br>#sheisbella<br>#iitsanexperience</div>
